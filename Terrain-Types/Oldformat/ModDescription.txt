This mod will change territories to neutral. Consult the Theme in the settings to determine which territories will change, such as the 'Sea Tiles' theme which affects all territories commonly seen as ocean territories.
When a special unit from a specific mod (The mod used can be found in settings) enters one of these themed territories, that territory will be immune from the affects of this mod. I.E. sea Tiles with a Ship special unit now creates navel combat
