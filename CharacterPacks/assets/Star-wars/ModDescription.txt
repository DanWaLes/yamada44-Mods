This is the Star Wars Pack and has a sci-fi fantasy leaning theme. You can name each unit, give damage, how powerful they are, if only so many units can be placed per game and a few more.
Each Character can be Named in game by players. when that unit dies, a Order is created so every player can see when your unit died. (with its name)

This mod requires using commerce mode. To purchase the Units, visit the commerce build menu and pay its cost. Setting the max amount will disable the unit
